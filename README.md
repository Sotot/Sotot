Hey there, welcome to my GitHub page 👋🏻

Young French developer of 18 years old, I am however studying law at the University of Grenoble Alpes (UGA). No relation with computer science, so what? Am I judging you ? Naughty 😡

Originally a Java developer (Minecraft plugins), I opened up very widely. Now I've converted to Discord bots with JavaScript. Note that my mathematical skills are equal to the economic capabilities of Zimbabwe (really), so don't type me too much 🤗


I wish you a good day 💙
(if you're passing through Zimbabwe, say it's from me)
