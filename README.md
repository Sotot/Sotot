Hello, welcome to my GitHub page 👋🏻

I'm a young French developer, but I studied law for three years. Nothing to do with computers, so what? Am I judging you? Naughty 😡

Originally a Java developer with Minecraft plugins, I opened up to other languages. Today, I find myself mainly in Discord bots with JavaScript. It's important to note that my math skills are equal to Zimbabwe's economic capabilities, i.e. not much, so don't type me too much 🤗.


Have a nice day 💙
(if you're ever in Zimbabwe, please say it's from me).
